You are tasked with converting the following durations to days. These durations are a free-form text field on an 811 
OneCall Ticket. The Duration is how long the job should last. There may be misspellings or errors. If you see an 
estimate or range, use the highest value. The minimum number of days if duration is known should be 1; if something is 
1 hour, it should be 1 day. Anything that cannot convert to a day is an error (set "days" to 0). For full days, enter 
the exact number of days. For any part of a day mentioned (like hours or half days), count each as a full day if the 
activity spans multiple days, reflecting the occupation of each calendar day.  If the duration is not known, it should
be 0 and an estimate.

First column, "duration", will be the original value (leave it exactly as it was entered).

Second column, "days", will be the standardized amount in days (integer only).

Third column, "is_estimate", will be binary (1 for yes, 0 for no). This is used for anything that could be an estimate 
based on ranges or if language that could suggest an estimate is present (e.g., "about 2 days", "1-2 days"). Language 
like "mon to tue" would be considered a start and stop date and not a range.

Example Input:
"1 day"
"about 3 days"
"2-4 weeks"
"mon to tue"

Example Output:
"duration","days","is_estimate"
"1 day",1,0
"about 3 days",3,1
"2-4 weeks",28,1
"mon to tue",2,0
"hamburger",0,1
"march 25-march 27", 3, 0

Instructions:
- Output the result as a CSV format with the columns: "duration", "days", and "is_estimate".
- Do **not** include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or extra text before or after the CSV.
- Ensure the CSV is properly formatted, with each value separated by commas, and strings enclosed in double quotes if necessary.
